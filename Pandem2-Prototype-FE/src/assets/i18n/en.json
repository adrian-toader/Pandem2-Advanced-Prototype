The Epidemiological component (epi) models the transmission dynamics of an acute infectious disease such as avian influenza by categorising individuals according to their infectious status (Susceptible-Exposed- Infectious-Recovered). This structure allows users to estimate the proportion of people infected and, more importantly, test the likely effect of public policies aimed at controlling the spread of the disease. This component also provides the signal for the Hospital module, driving the demand for hospital resources.",
        "OVERVIEW_PARAGRAPH_2": "2. The Hospital module models the movement of patients through the hospital system and focuses on ward beds and ICU beds. Patient pathways - from waiting for a ward or ICU bed, to admission to a ward or ICU (or to overflows), to occupying a ward or ICU bed, to patient discharges or deaths - are all governed over time by adjustable model parameters, e.g. hospitalisation rate, mortality rate and average length of stay in ICU. The number of patients in the various stages of this simulated process (e.g. waiting for a bed or in a ward bed) each provide a signal for the Hospital resources module, where associated resource needs and current usage will be calculated.",
        "OVERVIEW_PARAGRAPH_3": "3. The Hospital Resources module calculates the need for resources for patients who need or who occupy a ward bed or an ICU bed. Ward patients each need not only a physical bed but a share of a nurse's time. ICU patients need a physical ICU bed, a share of an ICU nurse's time, and many will also require a ventilator. All nurses require PPE in order to work safely with patients. All these resources are limited, and availability and gaps are calculated. This module also calculates the number of staffed ward beds and staffed, equipped ICU beds available, and these provide signals back to the Hospital module, where they are used to limit admission flows into ward beds and ICU beds.",
        "OVERVIEW_PARAGRAPH_4": "The three modules, represented in the above diagram, are all contained within one Stella Architect model (.stmx) file. It is a system dynamics (compartmental) model.",

These patients are admitted either to ward or directly to ICU (depending on the parameter fraction ICU). Ward patients stay in the ward for the average length of stay, before being discharged, being admitted to ICU, or dying (according to parameters LOS ward, fraction ward to ICU and ward fatality rate). ICU patients stay in ICU for the average length of stay, before being discharged to a ward or dying (according to parameters LOS ICU and ICU fatality rate).",

        "HOSPITAL_RESOURCES_PARAGRAPH_5": "The key resources of interest are operable ward beds and ICU beds. These consist of several of the above resources in particular combinations and proportions. An operable, or staffed, ward bed requires one physical bed and a share of a nurse's time. An operable, or staffed and equipped ICU bed, is similar, but will usually also require a ventilator. All staff require PPE. These resources dependencies can be represented as shown below:",

        "HOSPITAL_RESOURCES_PARAGRAPH_7": "The Hospital Resources module calculates the capacity of staffed ward beds and staffed, equipped ICU beds available over time.

        "HOSPITAL_RESOURCES_PARAGRAPH_8": "The model variable staffed ward beds available (circled, above) provides a signal back to the Hospital module (below), where it limits the flow of admissions into ward beds over time. Patients are sent to ward overflow if there is no available capacity.",

They were estimated by our public health partners for a fictional novel avian flu pandemic to be used for the Pandem-2 Functional Exercise.",

        "HOSPITAL_RESOURCES_PARAGRAPH_14": "Any model is necessarily a simplification of complex reality but can nevertheless be useful. Modelling is done for a specific purpose, not to represent reality in every detail. Simplicity of structure has the advantage of making the model more understandable and can often capture the most important behaviour of interest. It is important to state model assumptions for transparency. The model assumptions listed below are some of the key assumptions (not exhaustive) made in consultation with project partners when building this resources model. They can be reviewed and refined in further iterations of model development as required, and where data exists or can be estimated for the necessary parameter values.",
        "HOSPITAL_RESOURCES_TABLE_CONTENT_1": "Ward overflow patients have the same outcomes as ward patients (LOS, deaths and discharges). This is because sicker patients will be prioritised and will not go to overflow.",

        "HOSPITAL_RESOURCES_TABLE_CONTENT_7": "Bodies are usually taken from hospital beds and held in hospital morgues until funeral homes arrange to collect them. If morgues are swamped, bodies cannot be taken from the beds, and this can be a 'bed blocker'. If there are more beds blocked than the threshold number, emergency measures are taken (e.g. calling in the army) to remove bodies to temporary morgues.",
        "HOSPITAL_RESOURCES_TABLE_CONTENT_8": "Peak demand for resources is calculated using a 'no limits' scenario, in which all patients presenting in hospital will have their care needs met. Otherwise, peak demand for some resources can be underestimated (for example only ventilators needed for patients in ICU would be counted, not taking into account ICU overflow patients).",

Ward patients have HFNO or LFNO (high flow or low flow nasal oxygen) for one day less than LOS. ICU patients use ventilators for all their time in ICU. Ventilators are only used in ICU.",

        "HOSPITAL_RESOURCES_TABLE_CONTENT_12": "When workload is increased to meet demand, ward and ICU nurses 'burn out' at the same rate (default 5%). This effect is invoked when the nurse to patient ratio is reduced, meaning that nurses have to work harder to see more patients.",

Emotion analysis further identifies emotions conveyed in the text using the eight basic categories of emotions by Plutchik (e.g. sad, anger, happy, joy, etc).
